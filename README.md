Command line tools (mostly python) for processing FCS (Flow Cytometry Standard) files, in particular for reading the header of these files.
The FCS format is a binary format used for storing flow cytometry data and metadata.
These python scripts mostly read the metadata.
These should work on FCS 2 and FCS 3.
